            <p>katy grew up figure skating, but after ten years on ice, she left the sport to move to new york and study art history at columbia university. as a break from her studies, she sought out forms of movement that, like skating, used strength and flexibility in tandem. she soon discovered that yoga was the perfect outlet whenever she missed the ice.</p>
            <p>her initial studies were in ashtanga, and in 2015, she completed her 100-hour ashtanga training at pure yoga. after a series of yoga-related injuries, she began seeking out practices that retained the athleticism of ashtanga but prioritized safety and accessibility for all bodies. her studies led her to yoga vida, where she pursued a 200-hour ryt, an advanced mentorship program, and a restorative certification.</p>
            <p>katy’s classes are open-level musically charged flows, blending creative sequencing with a focus on anatomical integrity. her sequences are structured to build strength and body awareness so that students can explore mobility from a place of control. her studies of pilates under physiotherapist chloe gregor influence her approach to both her own yoga practice and her teaching: katy often incorporates basic pilates principles into her group yoga classes to help access the deep core, safely explore spinal mobility, and encourage full-body integration in yoga postures.</p>
            <p>currently, katy is pursuing a 100-hour advanced training in the threes physiyoga method. physiyoga blends yoga and physical therapy principles, applying knowledge of functional anatomy and biomechanics to the yoga context and empowering teachers to assess and restore suboptimal movement patterns.</p>
            <p>when she’s not on the mat, katy works as a book designer, creating publications for modern and contemporary art museums and galleries. she loves ceramics, typography, bookbinding, printmaking, biking, traveling, cooking, and, of course, yoga.</p>
